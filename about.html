            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            The Green Party of the United States is a grassroots national party. We're the party for "We The People," the health of our planet, and future generations instead of the One Percent. We welcome all those who refuse to accept a choice limited to the Two Parties of War and Wall Street. <br><br>
            
            We are an independent political party that is connected to American social movements, and is part of a global Green movement that shares key values, including our Four Pillars: Peace and Non-Violence, Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, and Social Justice, and our Ten Key Values. Currently we have more than 100 elected officials around the country, mostly at the municipal level, working to enact Green policies. We run many candidates who put Green issues on the table in elections at every level. We don’t take corporate money. We are working to build clean government that works for all of us – not just the 1%. We are fighting for the future.
