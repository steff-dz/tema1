                <h2>Who we are</h2>

                <p>Welcome to the Green Party of the United States (GPUS), an independent political party that is connected to American social movements, and is part of a global Green movement that shares key values, including our Four Pillars: Peace and Non-Violence, Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, and Social Justice, and our Ten Key Values.</p>
    
                <p>We are a federation of state parties. We have a presence in most states. Find your state party here.</p>
    
                <p>Currently we have more than 100 elected officials around the country, mostly at the municipal level, working to enact Green policies. We run many candidates who put Green issues on the table in elections at every level.</p>
    
                <p>We don’t take corporate money. We are working to build clean government that works for all of us – not just the 1%. We are fighting for the future.</p></div> -->
