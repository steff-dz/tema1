            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            The Green Party of the United States is a grassroots national party. We're the party for "We The People," the health of our planet, and future generations instead of the One Percent. We welcome all those who refuse to accept a choice limited to the Two Parties of War and Wall Street. <br><br>
            
            We are an independent political party that is connected to American social movements, and is part of a global Green movement that shares key values, including our Four Pillars: Peace and Non-Violence, Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, and Social Justice, and our Ten Key Values. Currently we have more than 100 elected officials around the country, mostly at the municipal level, working to enact Green policies. We run many candidates who put Green issues on the table in elections at every level. We don’t take corporate money. We are working to build clean government that works for all of us – not just the 1%. We are fighting for the future.

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            The Green Party is now in its fourth decade. Founded in 1984, the party has run a national ticket in every presidential election since 1996. In 2000, nominee Ralph Nader received nearly three million votes; in 2012, Jill Stein received the most votes for a woman in a presidential election in U.S. history. There have also been hundreds of Greens elected across the nation, from state legislatures and mayors down to local zoning boards. <br><br>
            
            In May 1984, when progressive politics in the United States was fighting for survival, a Green Movement Committee was founded with the goal of “the formation of a Green political organization in the USA.” The committee declared, “To be effective, a Green political organization must originate from a broad base of support, from natural allies concerned with ecological politics and social justice, peace and non-violence, local and regional self-management and grassroots democracy.” That summer, the founding meeting of U.S. Greens took place in St. Paul, Minnesota.<br><br>

            While the Green movement was just sprouting in America, it was taking root in West Germany. The U.S. Greens were inspired by the Four Pillars of the West German Greens: ecology, social justice, grassroots democracy, and non-violence. They also decided that, in the spirit of grassroots activism and democracy, the emerging party would go from the ground up, with local and state organizations having the most important role.
