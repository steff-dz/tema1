                        <p>Falling wages and rising bills are hitting most of us, and the most vulnerable are hit the hardest. We demand a living wage and a real safety net. We work for universal healthcare, free higher education, human rights for all immigrants, full reproductive rights for women, human rights for all immigrants and for LGBTQs, and racial justice: Black Lives Matter!</p></div>

                        <p>We demand public financing of elections, open debates, and more representative voting systems. Greens will lead the opposition to the Trump-Pence agenda, and we will not comrpromise, capitulate or go along with bipartisan consensus. And we accept no corporate contributions! </p></div>

                Government must be part of the solution, but when it’s controlled by the 1%, it’s part of the problem. The longer we wait for change, the harder it gets.<br><br>
